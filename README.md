Experimental Rust SDK for [Deepgram](https://www.deepgram.com/). Power your apps with world-class speech and Language AI models.

> This SDK only supports hosted usage of api.deepgram.com.

## Getting an API Key

üîë To access the Deepgram API you will need a [free Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys).
## Documentation

You can learn more about the Deepgram API at [developers.deepgram.com](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs).

## Current Status

This SDK is still very much work-in-progress. The interface is subject to rapid change.
## Install

From within your Cargo project directory, run the following command:

```sh
cargo add deepgram
```

You will also probably need to install [`tokio`](https://crates.io/crates/tokio):

```sh
cargo add tokio --features full
```
